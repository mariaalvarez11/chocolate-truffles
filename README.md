INSTRUCTIONS
1. Finely chop the chocolate. Finely chop the chocolate â€” a serrated knife will do this quickly and efficiently. Transfer the chocolate to a medium bowl.
2. Heat the cream. Microwave the cream on high until hot but not boiling, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Alternatively, heat the cream over low heat in a small saucepan until steaming.
3. Cover the chocolate in the cream to melt. Pour the hot cream over the chopped chocolate and set aside for 5 minutes.
4. Whisk until smooth. Whisk the cream and chocolate together until smooth and shiny.
5. Pour the ganache into a shallow pan and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Pour the ganache into a shallow pan or baking dish, such as an 8x8-inch baking dish. Refrigerate until firm,    about 30 minutes.
6. Scoop and roll the truffles. Use a tablespoon or small cookie scoop to portion the ganache into 1-ounce portions (about 2 tablespoons each). Roll the balls between gloved hands    until smooth and place on a plate. Refrigerate for a few minutes while preparing the coatings.
7. Coat the truffles. For best results, pour the coatings into small dishes or bowls. Dip and roll the truffles in the coatings.
8.Storing and serving the truffles. These truffles keep best in the refrigerator. Remove from the refrigerator about 30 minutes before serving.
